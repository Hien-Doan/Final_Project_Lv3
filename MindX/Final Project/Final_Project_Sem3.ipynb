    "# **Business scenario and problem:**\n",
    "The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve the employees satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?\n",
    "\n",
    "my goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "BY predicting if an employees is likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company."
